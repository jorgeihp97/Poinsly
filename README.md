# Poinsly

Poinsly is a programming Language to help solve Linear and Quadratic equations.
  - Poinsly uses linear and quadratic equations to finds its roots and it also graphs the equation.
  - The main technologies used in this programming language are SLY, cmath and matplotlib.
  - The most challenging part while creating the program was creating a functional equation. It took a bit of time to implement the tokens that recieves positive and negative numbers.
  - Future implementations will be accepting higher degree polinomials and graphing them. Polinomials with the power of 3 or more.
  - Poinsly can be installed using anaconda and VScode. Using a virtual machine in vscode you can call anaconda to make use if the language.
  - In VScode you can run the program and directly input an equation.
